<h1>Array Visualizer</h1>

This web application, named Array Visualizer, provides an interactive and visual representation of various array manipulation algorithms. It allows users to observe and comprehend the sorting process through animated circles.
Features

  Dynamic Visualization: Circles representing array elements are dynamically rendered on the screen.
  User Interaction: Adjust the number of circles, animation speed, and trigger shuffle or various sorting algorithms.
  Sorting Algorithms: Currently supports Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. Easily extendable for additional algorithms.
  Min Finding: Find and highlight the minimum element in the array.

<h2>How to Use</h2>

  Number Count Slider: Adjust the number of circles by moving the slider.
  Animation Speed Slider: Control the animation speed of the sorting process.
  Shuffle Button: Randomly rearrange the elements in the array.
  Sort Buttons: Initiate sorting using Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort.
  Find Min Button: Highlight the minimum element in the array.

<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<h3>Bubble Sort</h3>

  Iteratively compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  Repeats the process until /the array is sorted.

<h3>Selection Sort</h3>

  Divides the array into sorted and unsorted portions.
  Finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
  Repeats until the entire array is sorted.

<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>

  Builds a sorted portion of the array one element at a time.
  Takes each element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted portion.
